This application is based on Brazilian Health Minstery's database.

Source code is available on the GitHub.

It is a very simple application, you just have to choose the date range using the slide bar located on the left side. 
It will be showed the number of deaths by year and its distributions on the territory (map) on the right part. I hope you enjoy it!
